# Raspberry component

This component talks to a Raspberry Pi through Bluetooth, and controls
GPIO pins. It will currently be used for costumes in Ragnar√∂k, but who
knows how generic it will end up?

## How to use

You need a Raspberry Pi and a laptop, both with bluetooth.

- Connect something between the ground pin and GPIO pin 14 on the Raspberry
- Copy `raspberry_script.py` to the Raspberry Pi
- Change `serverMACAddress` in `raspberry_script.py` to the MAC address of the laptop's bluetooth device
- On the laptop, run `CORE=<core IP> make dev`
- On the Raspberry, run `python raspberry_script.py`
- You can now control whatever you connected from Core
